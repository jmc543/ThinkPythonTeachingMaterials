# n = 42 is legal, but 42 = n does not work: 
# (uncomment out line to see the error)
#42 = n

# now x and y are both set to 1:
x = y = 1

# ending a line with a semi-colon is fine, but has no special effect:
a = 1;

# putting a period at the end of a statement mostly causes a syntax error,
# with the exception of at end of a number (causes number to be float)
# syntax error:
#b = "hello".
# float (c equals 5.0):
c = 5.

# you can't multiple variables with math notation, e.g. xy is not defined
#z = xy
